Scheme
  - Is this real? Is it secure?
    - discussion that ECC is not secure against adversarial mistakes
    - suggestion that somebody could e.g. swap columns of symbols
    - suggestion that users read the postscript
  - How does this compare to SLIP39?
    - more detailed comparison between the checksum strengths
    - no pw, hardening, etc
  - How does this compare to BIP39?

Usage
  - Why would anybody use this?
  - How long will it take?
  - Can I use it for passwords? For safe combos etc?
     - suggest repitition code for safe combos
       - observe that SSSS will still work with a repetition code
     - suggest not using bech32 for passwords

HWW Support
  - What hardware wallets support this scheme?
  - Can I just convert to/from SLIP39? To/from BIP39?

Dice Worksheet
  - Do I actually have to re-roll the dice twice?
  - How can I speed things up?
     - using a tupperware
     - using >6 sides
     - using >5 dice
