      <h1>General</h1>
      <h2>Is this real? Is it secure?</h2>
      <p>Yes, this is a real project, and one of us (Pearlwort) is storing a nontrivial
      amount of Bitcoin with it. However, because of the lack of hardware wallet support,
      we don't yet recommend anybody else do this.</p>

      <p>As far as security, this scheme uses the simple mathematics of Shamir's Secret
       Sharing Scheme. It avoids complications related to random number generation by
       asking users to use dice, and avoids complications related to implementation
       details by basically having users do the math by hand, using simple lookup tables
       (in the form of volvelles) to assist.</p>

      <p>Mathematically inclined readers can read the <a href="../docs/2022-09-26--math.pdf">mathematical companion</a>
       for more information.</p>

      <h2>How does this compare to SLIP39?</h2>
      <p>This scheme is essentially the same as SLIP39, with the following differences:</p>
      <p><ul>
        <li>The checksum is longer, slightly stronger, and designed to be computable by hand.</li>
        <li>Our encoding is more compact, giving us room for a bit of more metadata,
         which is also designed to be readable by hand.</li>
        <li>Unlike SLIP39, we do not support passphrases or hardening of any form.</li>
        <li>Unlike SLIP39, we have no hardware wallet support. But we hope that will change!</li>
      </ul></p>

      <h2>How does this compare to BIP39?</h2>
      <p>BIP39 is a trainwreck of a protocol with the following issues, shared with neither
       codex32 nor SLIP39:</p>
      <p><ul>
         <li>BIP39 is encoded using 11-bit words, making it extremely hard to convert it
          to any other format without use of computers.</li>
         <li>BIP39 has an 4- or 8-bit checksum, which is too small to provide meaningful protection
          against random errors, and smaller than a single word, meaning that the "checksum
          word" also contains key data and so cannot simply be dropped.</li>
         <li>Compounding this, because you can't drop the last word, BIP39 encodes
          128-bit secrets in 132 bits and 256-bit secrets in 264 bits, so the data
          doesn't fit in normal data containers (e.g. codex32-encoded secrets).</li>
         <li>BIP39's checksum uses multiple SHA2 iterations so it cannot be verified without
          the use of electronic computers or multiple days(!!) of hand computation.</li>
         <li>BIP39's checksum provides <b>zero</b> protection against adversarial errors.
          It is easy to change even a single word of a BIP39 phrase in a way that it
          will appear to be valid and simply have no coins on it.</li>
         <li>Consequently BIP39 cannot provide <b>any</b> error correction capability.</li>
         <li>BIP39 seed words are converted to BIP32 seeds (what your wallet actually
          uses) using SHA-512 to extend the words to 512 bits, which is completely
          unnecessary and prevents you from simply converting the words to a BIP32 seed
          and forgetting about BIP39 entirely.</li>
         <li>BIP39 does this by <b>hashing the words themselves</b> even though it supports
          <b>wordlists in multiple languages</b> and provides <b>no in-band way to indicate
          which language is being used</b>. Every part of this is an independent mistake in
          the protocol design.</li>
      </ul></p>
      <p>I do not mean to disparage the authors of BIP39, who are intelligent, well-meaning,
       and have all made great contributions to the space. But BIP39 was designed in 2013
       when the Bitcoin ecosystem as a whole was lacking the institutional knowledge that
       we take for granted today, and you can tell.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately BIP39 is by far the most widely-supported mechanism for producing
       BIP32 seeds today, both because of its advanced age and because the aforementioned
       protections against converting BIP39 words into anything better.</p>

      <h1>Usage</h1>
      <h2>Why would anyone choose to use this?</h2>
      <p>See the booklet for more detail, but essentially the reason to use this scheme,
       even though it is very time consuming (see next question) and inconvenient, is
       that <b>you do not want an indefinite trust requirement on electronic computers.</b>
       codex32 lets you generate and distribute shares, and verify the checksums on said
       shares, entirely by hand.</p>
      <p>This means, for example, that if you are holding a codex32 share, you can check
       its integrity every year (say), and have a record that the share was recently
       intact and safe, even if it is years or decades old. To accomplish something
       using computers, you would need to use the hardware of the day, and at <i>some</i>
       point in the next century the "hardware of the day" will turn out to have some
       fatal security bug.</p>
      <p>Additionally, even during setup, codex32 gives you assurances that are impossible
       for computers to provide: that the randomness used during generation was uniform
       and un-tampered-with; that all intermediate computations were stored on specific
       sheets of paper and nowhere else; that the contents of said paper can then be
       securely and permanently destroyed; that there are no electromagnetic sidechannels;
       and (for a mathematically-inclined user) that the algorithms used are exactly
       what they are supposed to be.</p>
      <p>As a final benefit, anybody who is able to find a copy of the booklet will be
       able to recover your secret, even if the rest of the world has moved on and no
       protocols or hardware from the time of share creation is in use anymore.</p>

      <h2>How long will it take?</h2>
      <p>After some practice, you will likely be able to produce a 128-bit checksum
       worksheet (and a copy, to check against) in 30-40 minutes; translate shares
       in about 5 minutes, and add them in another 5.</p>
      <p>For a 2-of-3 scheme this works out to 3&times;40 + 3&times;5 = 2 hours and
       15 minutes to set up; then recovery takes about 10 minutes (but 40 minutes
       to check, if you check the recovered secret by hand).</p>

      <p>For a 3-of-5 scheme the same math gives works out to a bit under 5 hours
       to produce the shares, 15 minutes to recover and 40 minutes to check the
       recovery.</p>

      <p>Inexperienced users can expect to take 2-3 times this long.</p>
      <p>As long as you keep your incomplete work in a secure location, you can
       spread this work over several days, and/or enlist a highly-trusted accomplice.</p>

      <h2>Can I use this for passwords? For safe combinations?</h2>
      <p>Yes, but you will need to modify the checksum worksheet to be much shorter,
       and the resulting passwords may not contain any <tt>I</tt>'s, <tt>1</tt>'s,
       <tt>B</tt>'s or <tt>O</tt>'s. We do not recommend or endorse this.</p>
      <p>But it's possible.</p>

      <h1>Hardware Wallets</h1>
      <h2>What hardware wallets are supported?</h2>
      <p>As of September 2022, <b>none</b>.

      <h2>Can I interconvert my existing SLIP39 or BIP39 seed words?</h2>
      <p>In general, we do not recommend doing this, because the resulting composite scheme
      will be complicated and non-standard, <i>greatly</i> increasing the risk that you
      will lose funds simply by forgetting how your scheme works.</p>
      <p>Having said that, SLIP39 words represent 10-bit numbers, or two 5-bit bech32
      characters, so there is a natural way to convert a 128-bit or 256-bit seed from
      their wordlist to our encoding (and back), after which you can simply append
      the codex32 checksum.</p>
      <p>If you retain the SLIP39 header and checksum, your data will be longer than 128
      or 256 bits, and you will need a special purpose checksum worksheet. Our Documents
      page has such worksheets. But again, we strongly discourage this.</p>
      <p>For BIP39, the same caveats apply, but worse: BIP39 words represent <i>11 bits</i>,
      so the only way to convert them into 5-bit words by hand is to go through binary.
      This is error-prone and it is basically impossible to detect mistakes, since BIP39
      does have a human-verifiable checksum, but if you insist on doing it, there is a
      <a href="../docs/bip39-conversion-worksheet.pdf">worksheet and conversion table here</a>.
      Note that unlike SLIP39, there is no header to drop, and it is difficult to drop
      the checksum because it is embedded in the final word alongside actual data. You
      will also definitely need a computer to recover it.
      </p>

      <h1>Dice Worksheet</h1>
      <h2>Do I actually need to re-roll twice when my first two rolls were the same?</h2>
      <p>Yes, or else the results could be biased.</p>
      <p>One way to illustrate the problem is to imagine that you have a die that comes up
       one 99% of the time. Then with high probability, you will roll two ones; if you
       then just kept rolling the die until it came up with a different number, you'd
       be guaranteed to get a "1 bit" because the first roll was less than the final roll.
      </p>
      <p>To contrast, if you repeatedly rolled that die twice until finally one of the
       rolls was not 1, then there's a 50% chance that the non-1 roll would come first
       (a "1 bit") and a 50% chance it'd come second (a "0 bit").</p>

      <h2>How can I speed this up?</h2>
      <p>Keep practicing until you've memorized much of the volvelles, or get a
       partner to help fill in the worksheets (but make sure you trust this person
       with your Bitcoin secrets!)</p>
      <p>If you are really certain your dice are unbiased, it is also technically
       possible to directly generate characters instead of the Random Character
       Worksheet. But if you do this wrong, you might introduce bias anyway. We
       will not condone or endorse this, and we will not tell you how to do it.</p>
