    <h1>Codex32</h1>
    <p>Codex32 is an error-correcting code designed to be computable without the use of
    electronic computers. Users can compute and verify checksums by hand; we have
    provided lookup tables, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volvelle">volvelles</a>
    and worksheets to assist with this process.</p>
    <p>The codex32 checksum, like all linear codes, is compatible with
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir%27s_Secret_Sharing">Shamir's Secret Sharing
    Scheme</a>, a mechanism to split a secret into many "shares", such that the original
    secret can be reconstructed from some number of them. In SSSS, users choose a threshold
    value <i>k</i>, typically 2 or 3; they then generate <i>k</i>-many random shares, and
    then compute a number of derived shares (up to 31 in total). A random secret can then
    be computed from any <i>k</i> shares.</p>
    <p>If the initial random shares have a valid codex32 checksum, then so will all the
    derived shares and the final secret.</p>
    <h1>Getting Started</h1>
    <p>The premise behind codex32 is that you will be generating, checksumming and splitting a
    <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki">BIP32</a>
    master seed, from which you will derive Bitcoin addresses. Before getting started,
    make sure you have a Bitcoin wallet which is able to import codex32-encoded seed
    shares.
    </p>
    <p><b>As of this writing (September 2022), no such wallets exist. Therefore this project
    should be considered as a fun experiment, but cannot be used in practice.</b> Very
    reckless users can consider coercing their SLIP39 or BIP39 seed words into the
    codex32 encoding, and then converting back before wallet import.</p>
    <p>That caveat aside, let's get started!</p>
    <p><ol>
    <li>The first step is to <a href="#">download and print the codex32 booklet</a>.
      <ul>
      <li>There are five pages which contain the volvelles, which should be printed on
      heavy paper or cardstock; the remainder can be printed on normal paper.</li>
      <li>We recommend using a colour printer, but it's not necessary.</li>
      <li>You will likely want to print multiple copies of the Checksum and Translation
      Worksheets. They are included in the full booklet or <a href="docs/index.html">you
      can download them individually.</a></li>
      </ul>
    <li>Cut out and assemble the volvelles, following the included instructions.</li>
    <li>Following the instructions in the booklet, generate your secret:
      <ul>
      <li>Choose a threshold <i>k</i>-of-<i>n</i>, e.g. 2-of-3, meaning that you
       will create 3 shares, any 2 of which will recover your secret.</li>
      <li>Using the Random Character Worksheet, create <i>k</i> random initial shares.</li>
      <li>Using the Translation Worksheet, create as many derived shares (up to 31 total)
       as you need to get up to <i>n</i>.</li>
      </ul></li>
    <li>To recover your secret, use the Recovery Wheel and Translation Worksheet, or
      directly enter your seeds into a codex32-enabled wallet.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Advanced users are encouraged to check out the <a href="https://github.com/roconnor-blockstream/SSS32/">git repo</a>
     for the booklet, which is implemented in hand-written PostScript, or to read the
     <a href="#">mathematical companion</a> for the underlying theory.</p>
    <h1>Interactive Tools</h1>
    <p>On this site, we have some <a href="interactive/index.html">interactive tools</a>
     which may help you getting started:</p>
    <p><ol>
      <li>The <b>New Initial Share</b> link is a copy of the paper Checksum Worksheet which
       automatically fills in cells based on your share data. It is worthwhile to check
       your work (using a dummy key!) against this tool before trying to use it for
       real data &mdash; if you mess up the Checksum Worksheet you may not be able to
       tell until you've spent upwards of an hour completing it, which is not a fun
       experience.
      <li>The <b>New Derived Share</b> (TODO) link allows you to derive additional shares
       from your initial ones.</li>
      <li>The <b>Error Correction</b> (TODO) link will let you correct errors in a
       share or secret. Unlike every other worksheet on this site, it is safe to use
       this worksheet with real secret data.
